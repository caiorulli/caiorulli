### Hello there!

My name is Caio Rulli and I'm a software engineer. Clojure developer by trade,
having also worked with Java, Javascript and Python, mostly in a backend web
development context. I am a functional programming enthusiast, I plan on hitting
my head into a wall until I learn proper Haskell, and, well, who knows what
next. I also really like Linux and gaming.

I have stopped using Github for my personal projects. If you want, you can check
them out in Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/caiorulli
